#### Want to use it in your project?

I use Jitpack to host this dependency, to use it, simple add this to your repositories in your **build.gradle**:
```Gradle
repositories {
	...
	maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```
```Gradle
dependencies {
        implementation 'uk.nstr:struckit:-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

If you're using Maven, it's just as simple:
```XML
<repositories>
	<repository>
	    <id>jitpack.io</id>
	    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
```
```XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>uk.nstr</groupId>
    <artifactId>struckit</artifactId>
    <version>-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

#### What else?
Not much else to say here right now. Stick around and maybe I will actually write a proper README.
